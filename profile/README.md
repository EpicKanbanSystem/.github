Kanban system for managing the flow of Epics.

Epics being the units of information for capturing large software needs in a way that encourages easier collective prioritisation.

This concept is an adaption of the SAFe portfolio Kanban system [1] with an emphasis on the Epic as a unit of information over what underlying portfolio of value streams the Kanban system represents.

Unlike with implementing SAFe, this Kanban system concept does not require a change to other existing team practices or structure, while maintaining that a SAFe practitioner could relate an Epic Kanban system to a SAFe Portfolio, ART, or Solution Train Kanban system, as part of implementing one of the four SAFe configurations [1].

The Epic Kanban system has two parts to it: The Epic (unit of information) and Kanban system (how Epics flow). Hence the reason for two of the repos in this github area.
